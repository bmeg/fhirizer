                    "description": "A phosphoramidate derivative of the monophosphate form of cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine; 3'-dA), an adenosine derivative first isolated from Cordyceps sinensis, with potential antineoplastic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon administration and cellular uptake of NUC-7738 by passive diffusion, cordycepin monophosphate (3'-dAMP) is converted into its active anti-cancer metabolite 3'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3'-dATP). 3'-dATP functions as a ribonucleoside analogue and competes with ATP during transcription. Therefore, this agent causes RNA synthesis inhibition, inhibits cellular proliferation, and induces apoptosis. Also, 3'-dAMP activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and reduces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. This prevents the hyperphosphorylation of the translation repressor protein 4E-BP1. This results in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation. mTOR, a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase (PIKK) family, plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation, and its expression or activity is frequently dysregulated in human cancers. Compared to cordycepin alone, the addition of the phosphoramidate moiety may overcome cancer resistance and allow for greater cytotoxicity as NUC-7738 does not require a nucleoside transporter for cellular uptake, is independent of  enzymatic activation by adenosine kinase (AK) and is not susceptible to enzymatic degradation by adenosine deaminase (ADA). Altogether, this may help overcome cancer resistance to cordycepin.",

Upon intramuscular administration of the Ad5/F35-hGCC-PADRE, the Ad5/F35 targets CD46, which is expressed widely on most tumor cells, and the virus is taken up by cells. Once inside the cells, the virus expresses hGCC. The expressed hGCC induces both humoral and cellular immune responses against tumor cells expressing the hGCC antigen. This results in the immune-mediated killing of tumor cells. The hGCC protein is normally restricted to intestinal epithelial cells but is overexpressed by metastatic colorectal tumors. PADRE is a helper T-lymphocyte epitope that is able to augment the magnitude and duration of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response. The inclusion of the chimeric Ad5/F35 fiber increases viral uptake in cells through CD46.",

This prevents the proliferation of rapidly growing cells, such as brain tumor cells. And by lowering glutamate plasma levels, a molecular imbalance is formed and glutamate is excreted across the blood-brain barrier, resulting in lower free brain glutamate.  This may help protect the brain from excitotoxicity in conditions where there is a surge of glutamate production, such as traumatic brain injury, thereby protecting neuronal cells.

Upon administration, the anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody JSP191 targets and binds to CD117. This prevents the binding of stem cell factor (SCF) to its receptor CD117 on HSCs.  As CD117 binding to SCF is critical for survival and maintenance of blood forming stem cells, blocking this interaction causes the HSCs that are present in the bone marrow niches to be depleted. JSP191 can potentially be used as a conditioning regimen to prepare patients for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

                    "description": "A bispecific monoclonal antibody composed of two single-chain variable fragments (scFv), one directed against the B-cell-specific membrane protein CD19, and another that is directed against the human cell surface antigen CD47, with potential immunostimulating, phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-CD47/CD19 bispecific monoclonal antibody TG-1801, the anti-CD19 moiety selectively targets and binds to CD19 on CD19-positive B-cells, thereby improving binding of the anti-CD47 moiety to the CD19+ malignant B-cells. The CD47 binding by TG-1801 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of the CD19/CD47-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, blocking CD47 signaling activates an anti-tumor T-lymphocyte immune response and T-cell-mediated killing of CD19/CD47-expressing tumor cells. In addition, TG-1801 induces an anti-tumor activity through the induction of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), widely expressed on normal, healthy cells, such as red blood cells and platelets, and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. CD19 is a membrane antigen that is widely expressed during B-cell development and in B-cell malignancies. By co-targeting CD47 and CD19, TG-1801 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis.",

Upon administration of anti-CTLA-4 probody BMS-986288, the masking peptide is cleaved by tumor-associated proteases upon extravasation into the tumor microenvironment (TME). Protease-mediated removal of the linker enables binding of the unmasked monoclonal antibody moiety to CTLA-4, which is expressed on certain T-cells.

Upon administration of anti-globo H/MMAE ADC OBI 999, the antibody moiety of OBI 999, OBI 888, targets and binds to globo H on tumor cells and is rapidly internalized, thereby delivering MMAE intracellularly. Upon proteolytic cleavage, MMAE targets and binds to tubulin and inhibits its polymerization, resulting in G2/M checkpoint arrest and apoptosis in globo H-expressing tumor cells. Globo H, a hexasaccharide glycosphingolipid, is (over)expressed on the surface of many types of tumor cells. Globo H is minimally or not expressed on healthy, normal cells; its expression on cancer cells is associated with increased proliferation and poor prognosis.",

                    "description": "A bispecific antibody fusion protein directed against the human negative immunoregulatory checkpoint receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279) and the human cell surface antigen CD47, with potential immunostimulating, phagocytosis-inducing and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration of anti-PD-1/CD47 infusion protein HX009, the agent simultaneously and selectively targets and binds to PD-1 expressed on T-lymphocytes and CD47 on tumor cells. The CD47 binding by HX009 blocks the interaction of CD47 with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha), an inhibitory protein expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which prevents CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated signaling and abrogates the CD47/SIRPalpha-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis. This induces pro-phagocytic signaling mediated by the binding of calreticulin (CRT), which is specifically expressed on the surface of tumor cells, to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP), expressed on macrophages, which results in macrophage activation and the specific phagocytosis of the CD47-expressing tumor cells. The binding of HX009 to PD-1 blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). This prevents the activation of PD-1 and its downstream signaling pathways. This may restore effector T-cell functions and may further activate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated tumor cell killing. CD47, also called integrin-associated protein (IAP), is a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), widely expressed on normal, healthy cells, such as red blood cells and platelets, and overexpressed on the surface of a variety of cancer cells. Expression of CD47, and its interaction with SIRPalpha, leads to the inhibition of macrophage activation and protects cancer cells from phagocytosis, which allows cancer cells to proliferate. By co-targeting CD47 and PD-1, HX009 has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing CD47-targeted therapies by possibly avoiding the side effects caused by binding to CD47 on healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which causes unwanted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. PD-1, an inhibitory receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), is expressed on activated T-lymphocytes; it functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands, and plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",

Upon administration, anti-PD1/CTLA4 bispecific antibody MEDI5752 targets and binds to both PD-1 and CTLA4 expressed on tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs), and inhibits the PD-1- and CTLA4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation and proliferation. In addition, MEDI5752 is internalized and is able to degrade PD-1. This restores immune function and activates a sustained cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune response against tumor cells. Both PD-1 and CTLA4 are selectively expressed on TILs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and negatively regulate the activation and effector functions of T-cells. They play key roles in the downregulation of the immune system and tumor evasion from host immunity. Dual checkpoint blockade of PD1 and CTLA4 with MEDI5752 may enhance T-cell activation and proliferation more than the blockade of either immune checkpoint receptor alone. It may also decrease toxicity by avoiding the binding to CTLA-4-expressing T-cells that are devoid of PD-1. The engineered Fc domain may reduce Fc effector function.",

Upon intravenous administration, the monoclonal antibody moiety of NBE-002 targets and binds to ROR1 expressed on tumor cells. Upon binding and internalization, the anthracycline-based toxin intercalates into DNA and interacts with topoisomerase II. This leads to an inhibition of DNA replication and repair, and prevents RNA and protein synthesis. This kills the ROR1-expressing cancer cells. In addition, the PNU-159682 derivate may promote immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activate a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated anti-tumor immune response, thereby further killing the ROR1-expressing tumor cells. ROR1, also known as neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor-related 1 (NTRKR1), is expressed during embryogenesis and by certain leukemias. It plays key roles in tumor cell proliferation and survival.",

In addition, belantamab mafodotin induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Altogether, this results in the inhibition of cellular proliferation in tumor cells that overexpress BCMA. BCMA, a receptor for a proliferation-inducing ligand and B-cell activating factor, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and plays a key role in plasma cell survival; it is found on the surfaces of plasma cells and overexpressed on malignant plasma cells. Afucosylation of the antibody moiety increases ADCC.",

Blocking the phosphorylation and kinase activity of CK1alpha prevents the enhanced binding of murine double minute X (MDMX) to p53, the formation of CK1alpha and MDM2 complex, and the resulting inhibition of p53. This induces p53-mediated cell cycle arrest, slowing tumor cell proliferation. Blocking the phosphorylation and kinase activity of CDK7 and CDK9 prevents the positive transcription elongation factor b (PTEFb)-mediated activation of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and leads to the inhibition of gene transcription of various anti-apoptotic proteins. This also induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, slowing tumor cell proliferation. CK1alpha, a serine/threonine kinase and a leukemic stem cell target, acts as a tumor suppressor in several cancers through the negative regulation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and p53. It negatively regulates p53 by phosphorylating MDMX, thus enhancing binding of MDMX to p53, as well as by forming a complex with MDM2.

Upon oral administration of the cedazuridine/azacitidine combination agent ASTX030, cedazuridine binds to and inhibits CDA, an enzyme primarily found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and liver that catalyzes the deamination of cytidine and cytidine analogs. This prevents the breakdown of azacitidine, increases its bioavailability and efficacy while decreasing GI toxicity due to the administration of lower doses of azacitidine. Azacitidine exerts its antineoplastic activity through the incorporation of its triphosphate form into DNA, which inhibits DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), thereby blocking DNA methylation and results in hypomethylation of DNA. This interferes with DNA replication and decreases tumor cell growth.",

Upon administration, chlorotoxin (EQ)-CD28-CD3zeta-CD19t-expressing CAR T-lymphocytes are re-directed to specific tumor cells in the brain inducing selective toxicity in these tumor cells. CLTX, a 36-amino acid peptide found in the venom of the deathstalker scorpion (Leiurus quinquestriatus) and a chloride channel blocker, preferentially binds to glioma (and other neuroectodermal origin) cells via membrane bound forms of the endopeptidase matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). This may direct the T-lymphocytes to and induce selective toxicity in MMP-2-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, binding to MMP-2 on glioma cells may both interfere with transmembrane chloride exchange and inhibit proteolytic extracellular matrix remodeling by MMP-2, which may further limit the spread of these tumor cells. MMP-2 is specifically upregulated in gliomas and related cancers, but is not normally expressed in brain. The CD28 co-stimulatory molecule signaling domain enhances activation and signaling; its inclusion may increase proliferation of T-cells and antitumor activity compared to the inclusion of the CD3 zeta chain alone. IgG4-Fc (EQ) contains two point mutations in its spacer region which prevents recognition of the CAR by Fc receptors (FcRs) without altering the ability of the CAR to mediate antigen-specific lysis. CD19t, which lacks the cytoplasmic signaling tail, provides a non-immunogenic surface marker that allows for accurate measurement, efficient cell tracking and/or imaging of the therapeutic T-cells in vivo following adoptive transfer. Additionally, co-expression of CD19t functions as a \"suicide\" switch via clinically available antibodies or immunotoxins which can be used to selectively eliminate the genetically modified cells.",

TATE is an octreotide derivative in which phenylalanine at position 3 is substituted by tyrosine and position 8 threoninol is replaced with threonine. SSTRs have been shown to be present in large numbers on NET and their metastases, while most other normal tissues express low levels of SSTRs.",

Upon oral administration of DTRM-555, the DTRMWXHS-12 component inhibits the activity of BTK and prevents the activation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling pathway. This prevents both B-cell activation and BTK-mediated activation of downstream survival pathways, and leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B-cells that overexpress BTK. BTK plays an important role in the development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival of B-lymphocytes. The everolimus component binds to the immunophilin FK Binding Protein-12 (FKBP-12) to generate a complex that binds to and inhibits the activation of mTOR, a key regulatory kinase. Upregulated in some tumors, mTOR is a serine/threonine kinase involved in regulating cellular proliferation, motility, and survival that is located downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The pomalidomide component may inhibit TNF-alpha production, enhance the activity of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, pomalidomide may inhibit tumor angiogenesis, promote cell cycle arrest in susceptible tumor cell populations, and stimulate erythropoiesis.

Upon intratumoral administration of delolimogene mupadenorepvec, the virus infects and selectively replicates in tumor cells. This causes direct oncolysis and the release of a plethora of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) from the tumor cells. The released TAAs stimulate the immune system and activate anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby further killing tumor cells. In addition, infected tumor cells and tumor stroma cells, including stellate cells and infiltrating immune cells, express the immunostimulants CD40L and 4-1BBL. The expressed CD40L and 4-1BBL proteins activate the CD40L- and 4-1BBL-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. This activates antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs) and M1 macrophages. The DCs produce various cytokines, including interleukin-12 (IL12), IL21, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa), and interferon-gamma (IFNg), which leads to the activation and expansion of both T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Altogether, this modulates immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), disrupts tumor stroma, and causes additional immune stimulation against tumor cells, thereby inducing further tumor cell lysis. In addition, CD40L reduces myeloid suppressor cells in the TME. Inclusion of the chimeric Ad5/35 fiber targets CD46 and increases viral uptake in cells. Transgene expression is driven by a separate promoter to allow for efficient expression in both tumor cells and tumor stroma. Replication is restricted to tumor cells by the presence of the delta24 mutation in the E1A gene, which deletes the retinoplastoma protein (pRb)-binding domain and forces viral replication to be conditional on hyperphosphorylated pRb and a dysfunctional Rb pathway.",

Upon administration of dual variable domain immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig) ABT-165, the target-binding variable domains specifically recognize and simultaneously bind to their two antigens expressed on tumor cells. This may both prevent antigen-mediated signaling and lead to an inhibition of cellular proliferation in susceptible tumor cells. The antigen targets are overexpressed on certain tumor cell types. The DVD-Ig may have enhanced physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties as compared to their antibody counterparts.",

Upon administration, dociparstat sodium binds to both chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12) and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). This prevents the interaction of CXCL12 with CXCR4, blocks CXCR4 activation, and may result in decreased proliferation and migration in CXCR4-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction may induce mobilization of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow into the blood.  In addition, dociparstat sodium prevents the interaction of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) with its ligands, including advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), Mac-1(CD11b/CD18), the nuclear pro-inflammatory protein high mobility group box protein-1 (HMGB-1), carboxymethyl lysine-bovine serum albumin (CML-BSA) and members of the S100 calgranulin family. In addition, this agent inhibits the enzymes heparanase, cathepsin G, and human leukocyte elastase, which are involved in inflammation and metastasis. Altogether, this may inhibit tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis. Dociparstat sodium also binds to platelet factor 4 (PF4 or CXCL4) and may prevent PF4's inhibitory effect on platelet production. This may increase platelet production. Unlike heparin, this agent does not induce heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). RAGE, a receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, plays a key role in inflammation and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. CXCR4 is a chemokine receptor belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family that plays an important role in chemotaxis, chemoresistance and angiogenesis, and is upregulated in several tumor cell types. The interaction between CXCL12/CXCR4 induces retention of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow.",

Upon oral administration, metformin targets and inhibits complex I (NADPH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and increases the cellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio leading to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). This modulates AMPK-mediated transcription of target genes, which prevents hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, enhances insulin sensitivity and fatty acid oxidation, and increases glucose uptake and utilization in target tissues. This lowers blood glucose levels. Metformin may exert antineoplastic effects through AMPK-mediated or AMPK-independent inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is up-regulated in many cancer tissues. It also reduces cyclin D1. This inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, this agent also inhibits tumor cell migration and invasion by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression which is mediated through the suppression of transcription activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation. Also, metformin reduces hyperinsulinemia which may contribute to an anti-tumor effect. Metformin may increase the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time and may lower serum PSA levels.",

This prevents FLT3, KIT and CSF1R-mediated signaling and results in the inhibition of proliferation in tumor cells overexpressing FLT3, KIT and CSF1R.

This prevents CSF1R activation and CSF1R-mediated signaling in these cells. This blocks the production of inflammatory mediators by macrophages and monocytes and reduces inflammation. By blocking the recruitment to the tumor microenvironment and activity of CSF1R-dependent tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), NMS-03592088 inhibits the immunomodulating activity by macrophages and enhances T-cell infiltration and antitumor T-cell immune responses, which inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells.

With the phosphoramidate moiety on the gemcitabine monophosphate group, NUC-1031 has improved properties over its parent molecule: 1) is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, 2) as the agent is delivered in the monophosphate form, the first phosphorylation step by deoxycytidine kinase is not required, 3) this agent is not susceptible to deactivation by cytidine deaminase cleavage of the monophosphorylated form. Altogether, this may help overcome resistance to gemcitabine.",

Upon administration of the nucleotide analog prodrug fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is readily taken up by tumor cells. In the tumor cell, the phosphoramidate moiety is removed and fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide is converted to its active form FUDR-MP. In turn, FUDR-MP binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), resulting in the depletion of thymidine triphosphate (TTP) and thus DNA synthesis. With the phosphoramidate moiety attached to FUDR-MP, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide, compared to 5-FU, is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, thereby generating higher intracellular concentrations. In addition, compared to 5-FU, once inside the cell FUDR-MP does not need to be phosphorylated and is already in its active form. Unlike 5-FU, fosifloxuridine nafalbenamide does not get deactivated or converted into toxic metabolites by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) and thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which leads to both a longer half-life and less toxicity.",

Upon intravenous administration of the HER2-directed TLR8 agonist SBT6050, the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody targets and binds to HER2 expressed on tumor cells, thereby localizing the TLR8 agonist directly to the tumor site. In turn, the TLR8 agonist moiety binds to TLR8 expressed on myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). This activates myeloid cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid cell-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs), and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). This may lead to the activation of nuclear factor NF-kappa-B, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, macrophage-induced tumor cell killing, inflammasome activation, activation of cytolytic natural killer (NK) cells and neutrophils, and the induction of a Th1-weighted anti-tumor immune response. It also reverses the suppression of senescent naive and tumor-specific T-cells, and enhances the anti-tumor cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) immune response. TLR8, like other TLRs, recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and plays a key role in innate and adaptive immunity.

LSD1 inhibition enhances H3K4 methylation and increases the expression of tumor suppressor genes. This may lead to an inhibition of cell growth in LSD1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, LSD1 demethylates mono- or di-methylated H3K9, which increases gene expression of tumor promoting genes; inhibition of LSD1 promotes H3K9 methylation and decreases transcription of these genes.

Unlike the constitutive proteasome, which is expressed in most tissues, immunoproteasome is specifically present in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells, including multiple myeloma.

Upon intravenous administration, the peptide moiety of letolizumab specifically targets and binds to CD40L expressed on T-lymphocytes. This prevents the binding of CD40L to its cognate receptor CD40 expressed on B-lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs). This prevents T-cell mediated proliferation and differentiation of B-cells, and prevents the production of antibodies. By inhibiting both the production of anti-glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antibodies by B-cells and GPIIb/IIIa-dependent T-cell proliferation, letolizumab may prevent platelet destruction and may increase platelet counts in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The direct binding of letolizumab to CD40L on platelets further prevents CD40L/CD40-mediated destruction by macrophages and DCs in ITP. The modified Fc domain prevents the binding of letolizumab to the Fc receptor FcgammaRIIA on platelets, thereby preventing FcgammaRIIA-dependent platelet activation and anti-CD40L-induced thromboembolism. CD40L, a transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, is primarily expressed on activated T-cells, but is also expressed on eosinophils, basophils, natural killer (NK) cells, mast cells, platelets and activated endothelial cells.",

Oligo-fucoidan has anti-inflammatory effects that suppress the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2), and decrease the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (TNFa). This agent may also suppress angiogenic activity by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor expression and VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation. As an antioxidant, this agent protects cells against oxidative stress by scavenging superoxide radicals and induces the expression of the anti-oxidant nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 and that of its target gene, superoxide dismutase; and prevents reactive oxidative species (ROS) generation in cancer cells and ROS release into the TME. Fucoidan also has immune-modulatory effects and enhances the proliferation of natural killer (NKs) cells and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs).",

Upon administration, oncolytic adenovirus ORCA-010 binds to specific Ad3 receptors that are highly expressed on certain tumor cells. This results in the replication of oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/3-delta24 in tumor cells and induces tumor cell lysis which may potentially result in the activation of a systemic immune response against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). The Ad5/3-delta24 has a 24 base pair deletion in constant region 2 of the E1A gene which allows for selective replication in cells that are defective in the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) or cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2A (CDKN2A or p16INK4a). As most tumor cells are defective in the Rb/p16 pathway, this virus selectively replicates in these cells. The RGD-4C motif is a 9-amino acid peptide that binds to various and enhances viral-cell receptor binding by allowing for a Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR)-independent infection of tumor cells, which is the natural route of viral binding, as CAR expression is often deficient on cancer cells. As integrins are often overexpressed on tumor cell surfaces, integrin receptor binding enhances tumor cells binding and infection by the Ad. The T1 mutation enhances the Ad5 release from tumor cells and promotes spreading throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing anti-tumor activity. The T1 mutation, a single Adenine insertion at position 445 of the nucleotide sequence of the E3/19K gene of Adenovirus, creates a truncated E3/19K protein that is relocated to the plasma membrane due to the disruption of its ER retention signal. This increases plasma membrane permeability and enhances the release of Ad5.",

In addition, oHSV-1 expressing IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody T3011 promotes the secretion of IL-12 and anti-PD-1 antibody by the tumor cells. IL-12 promotes the activation of natural killer cells, which induces both the secretion of interferon-gamma and a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against the tumor cells.

BTK, a member of the Src-related BTK/Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed or mutated in B-cell malignancies; it plays an important role in the development, activation, signaling, proliferation and survival of B-lymphocytes.",

PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 consists of three monovalent antibody Fvs specific for PD-L1, HSA and 4-1BB fused in a single chain. Upon administration, PD-L1/4-1BB/HSA trispecific fusion protein NM21-1480 simultaneously targets and binds to a membrane-distal epitope of 4-1BB, which is expressed on a variety of leukocyte subsets including activated T-lymphocytes, and PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells. The simultaneous binding to PD-L1 enables clustering of 4-1BB and thereby allows for conditional stimulation of 4-1BB signaling in the tumor microenvironment (TME) only upon binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells. 4-1BB activation results in T-cell stimulation and enhances T-lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor activity. At the same time, NM21-1480 prevents PD-L1 from binding to and activating its receptor, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; PDCD1; CD279; programmed death-1). This abrogates T-cell inhibition, activates antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and enhances cytotoxic T-cell-mediated tumor cell lysis, which may lead to a reduction in tumor growth. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on activated T-cells inhibits the expansion and survival of CD8-positive T-cells, suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion. 4-1BB, a surface glycoprotein of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, is an inducible costimulatory receptor that plays a key role in T-cell proliferation, survival and cytolytic activity. HSA fusion prolongs the half-life of NM21-1480. The conditional activation of 4-1BB signaling prevents systemic T-cell activation and lowers toxicity.",

As fatty acids are essential for tumor cell growth in FAO-dependent tumor cells and are needed for the metabolism of suppressive immune cells in the TME, including regulatory T-cells (Tregs), reducing the amount of fatty acids leads to a direct killing of FAO-dependent tumor cells. It also skews macrophages from the immune suppressive M2 phenotype to an effector M1 phenotype and facilitates the cytotoxicity of immune effector cells, thereby stimulating an anti-tumor immune response and further killing tumor cells.

Upon administration of pacmilimab, the linkage system is stable in the circulation and, upon extravasation into the tumor microenvironment, the peptide mask is cleaved by tumor-associated proteases. These proteases are present in high concentrations and aberrantly activated in the tumor microenvironment, while expressed as inactive forms, at much lower concentrations, in normal, healthy tissue. Protease cleavage of the linker enables binding of the unmasked, fully active monoclonal antibody moiety of CX-072 to PD-L1, which is over expressed on certain cancer cells. This blocks the binding to and activation of its receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) on T-lymphocytes, thereby enhancing the T-cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response and reversing PD-L1/PD-1-mediated T-cell suppression. PD-L1 binding to PD-1 on T-cells suppresses the immune system and results in immune evasion.

                    "description": "An orally available protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor that targets the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless homolog 1 (SOS1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, pan-KRAS inhibitor BI 1701963 selectively targets and binds to SOS1, thereby preventing the interaction of SOS1 with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) in the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound 'off' state, which is the inactivated state of KRAS. This abrogates the exchange of RAS-bound GDP for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and prevents the formation of GTP-loaded KRAS, which is the activated 'on' state of KRAS. This prevents activation of downstream RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway by GTP-loaded KRAS. This inhibits mutant KRAS-dependent signaling and may inhibit growth and survival of KRAS-expressing tumor cells. KRAS is a member of the RAS family of oncogenes that is mutated in many cancer cell types. Mutations of KRAS may induce constitutive signal transduction leading to tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and metastasis. SOS1 regulates the KRAS GDP-GTP cycle and promotes nucleotide exchange and formation of 'active' KRAS-GTP.",

TRK, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activated by neurotrophins, is encoded by NTRK family genes.

Upon administration, the pan-mutation-selective EGFR inhibitor CLN-081 specifically and covalently binds to and inhibits a variety of EGFR mutations, with particularly high selectivity against EGFR Ex20ins, which prevents EGFR mutant-mediated signaling and leads to cell death in EGFR mutant-expressing tumor cells. Compared to some other EGFR inhibitors, CLN-081 may have therapeutic benefits in tumors with EGFR Ex20ins, as most EGFR mutant-selective inhibitors are not active against EGFR Ex20ins.

This may restore immune function through the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. PD-1, a transmembrane protein in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) expressed on T-cells, functions as an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T-cell activation and effector function when activated by its ligands programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) or 2 (PD-L2); it plays an important role in tumor evasion from host immunity.",

Upon administration of racemetyrosine/methoxsalen/phenytoin/sirolimus SM-88, racemetyrosine, being a dysfunctional and modified form of the non-essential amino acid tyrosine, is specifically taken up by cancer cells through the transporter L-amino acid transferase-1 (LAT1; CD98). As a tyrosine derivative and faulty amino acid protein building block, racemetyrosine prevents protein synthesis in cancer cells. Specifically, this prevents mucin-1 (MUC1) protein synthesis. MUC1 is highly overexpressed by most cancer cells and regulates the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cancer cells created from the altered metabolism that cancer cells utilize, by upregulating key antioxidant defenses and preventing ROS-mediated apoptosis. In the absence of MUC1, ROS levels are increased, leading to an increase in oxidative stress, and induction of apoptosis. Also, being a protective transmembrane protein, MUC1 is part of the protective layer on the outside of cancer cells and plays a key role in shielding the cancer cell from the immune system. The loss of MUC1 compromises the cell membrane, thereby making the cancer cell more vulnerable to be recognized and attacked by the immune system. Rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, increases the cancer cells' need for tyrosine uptake and increases the uptake of racemetyrosine by LAT1. Phenytoin stimulates the release of reactive lipid species by the liver which accumulate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are taken up by cancer cells, thereby further increasing ROS within the cancer cell and increasing oxidative-related apoptosis. Mehoxsalen promotes toxic electron transfer and increases melanin, increases oxidative reactions and production of ROS. This further stimulates oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. Normal cells do not regularly take up certain non-essential amino acids, such as tyrosine, but readily convert phenylalanine to tyrosine, so normal healthy cells are not expected to consume racemetyrosine.",

The binding of TRAIL to the Trimer-Tag allows TRAIL to form a stable covalently-linked homotrimer. Upon administration of recombinant human TRAIL-trimer fusion protein SCB-313, this fusion protein targets, binds to and trimerizes the TRAIL-receptors, pro-apoptotic death receptors (DRs) TRAIL-R1 (death receptor 4; DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (death receptor 5; DR5), expressed on tumor cells, thereby activating caspases and inducing apoptosis in TRAIL-R1/R2-expressing tumor cells. TRAIL, a homotrimeric type II transmembrane protein and member of the TNF superfamily of cytokines, plays a key role in the induction of apoptosis through TRAIL-mediated death receptor pathways. The pro-apoptotic cell surface receptors TRAIL-R1 and -R2, members of the TNF receptor family, are overexpressed by a variety of cancer cell types; The induction of receptor trimerization is needed for the initiation of the apoptotic signaling pathway. The TRAIL-Trimer retains similar bioactivity and receptor binding kinetics as native TRAIL but has more favorable pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity than native TRAIL.",

This leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferons (IFNs). Specifically, expression of IFN-beta (IFNb) enhances the cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) by CD8alpha-positive and CD103-positive dendritic cells (DCs) to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs).

CLEC12A, a myeloid differentiation antigen and member of the C-type lectin/C-type lectin-like domain (CTL/CTLD) superfamily, is overexpressed on myeloid leukemia cells, but not on normal early hematopoietic progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).",

Upon administration of ATP128, the Z12 moiety targets, binds to and penetrates antigen-presenting cells (APCs), specifically dendritic cells (DCs) and promotes the loading of the epitopes into the DCs and transports antigenic cargoes into both endosomal and cytosolic compartments. Upon processing and antigen presentation by MHC II and I, the immune system is stimulated and activates specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, respectively, against the multi-epitopes specific for the CRC cells, thereby killing the CRC cells.",

The trastuzumab binding to the tumor cells causes the engulfment of the BDC-1001-bound tumor cells by tumor-associated myeloid (TAM) cells and the TAMs travel to the lymph nodes. The DCs activated by the TLR7/8 agonist causes the activation of TLR7/8-mediated pathways, and stimulates the maturation and activation of DCs, thereby re-activating the immune system against the tumor cells. Activation of DCs results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)- and B-lymphocyte-mediated immune responses against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which lead to tumor cell lysis. TLR7 and 8, members of the TLR family, play fundamental roles in the activation of the innate immune system, myeloid cell responses and tumor antigen presentation. HER2 is overexpressed by a variety of tumor cell types.",

Upon administration, vorasidenib specifically inhibits mutant forms of IDH1 and IDH2, thereby inhibiting the formation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from alpha-ketoglutarate (a-KG). This prevents 2HG-mediated signaling and leads to both an induction of cellular differentiation and an inhibition of cellular proliferation in tumor cells expressing IDH mutations. In addition, vorasidenib is able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). IDH1 and 2, metabolic enzymes that catalyze the conversion of isocitrate into a-KG, play key roles in energy production and are mutated in a variety of cancer cell types. In addition, mutant forms of IDH1 and 2 catalyze the formation of 2HG and drive cancer growth by blocking cellular differentiation and inducing cellular proliferation.",

Inhibition of Wee1 promotes both premature mitosis and a prolonged mitotic arrest leading to cell death in susceptible tumor cells, such as p53-deficient or mutated human cancers that lack the G1 checkpoint, upon treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents. Unlike normal cells, most p53-deficient or mutated human cancers lack the G1 checkpoint as p53 is the key regulator of the G1 checkpoint and these cells rely on the G2 checkpoint for DNA repair to damaged cells. Annulment of the G2 checkpoint may therefore make p53-deficient tumor cells more vulnerable to antineoplastic agents and enhance their cytotoxic effect.

Upon oral administration,xevinapant targets and binds to the Smac binding groove on IAPs, including the direct caspase inhibitor X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), and the cellular IAPs 1 (c-IAP1) and 2 (c-IAP2). This inhibits the activities of these IAPs and promotes the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, as xevinapant inhibits the activity of IAPs, it may work synergistically with cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation to overcome tumor cell resistance to apoptosis. As IAPs regulate nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) signaling pathways, which drives the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, xevinapant may enhance anti-tumor immune responses when administered with certain immunomodulating agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. IAPs are overexpressed by many cancer cell types and suppress both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting active caspases via their baculoviral lAP repeat (BIR) domains. They contribute to chemo-radio-resistance of cancer cells to certain cytotoxic agents and radiation, promote tumor cell survival and are associated with poor prognosis in certain types of cancer.

Upon administration of zotatifin, this agent targets and binds to elF4A, and promotes eIF4A binding to mRNA with specific polypurine motifs within their 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), leading to the formation of a stable sequence-specific ternary complex with eIF4A and mRNA (elF4A- zotatifin-mRNA). This results in the translational repression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic proteins involved in tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis, such as KRAS, Myc, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6, cyclin D, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 and 2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; ERBB2), and beta-catenin. The inhibition of the expression of these oncogenes leads to the inhibition of various oncogenic signal transduction pathways. This inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in tumor cells. eIF4A, a RNA helicase and the rate-limiting component of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex, catalyzes the ATP-dependent unwinding of RNA duplexes and facilitates 43S ribosome scanning within the 5'-UTR. elF4A is activated by various oncogenic signaling pathways, including RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways, and regulates the translation of oncogenes and tumor survival factors with complex secondary structures within the 5'-UTRs that are required for tumor cell proliferation, survival and metastasis.",
